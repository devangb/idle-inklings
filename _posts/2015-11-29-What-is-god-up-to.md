**If you are reading this, then my article is false. If not, it is true.**

Okay. Big bang occurred. And created possibility of existence of matter and life form. But I will not talk about past, I write to tell you about future. Your future. Let’s face it, soon enough you will die, then what?

God must be having a bigger reason/purpose to conduct and overlook life form and the physics.

So, I will try to fit our beloved God in possible Earthly job profiles-

1. **God is an experimental physicist** — Playing with us and Physics, eventually trying to get the perfect value of gravity (or speed of light) so that he can create a perfect (or better) environment for future and more important breed (or probably himself). What God wants from that life form is incomprehensible. 
2. **God is a king** — For this you have to take my word for the parallel universe, each having its God. So, maybe God is feeding and raising us as soldiers for a war (not the usual earthly war or we would be dying in our youth, but some strange kind of war requiring strange kind of soldier skills).
3. **God is a child** (Not a job, but profile) — Playing with his toys- men and physics, satisfying his adrenaline rush. Don’t believe me, try a good deed and you sure will be rewarded by the childish heart. And this proves all the miracles happening around.
4. **God is a programmer** — And who knows that our life is nothing but augmented reality (or a matrix, if you please). We being nothing but objects of His, maybe having a bit of artificial intelligence. And the reasoning of our existence is, thus, not possible to tell ‘cause the intention variable is out of object’s scope.

> “There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened.” ~ **Douglas Adams** in **The Restaurant at the End of the Universe**

And now that you are reading it, proves that my theory is false.

Still, all of this is not enough to explain *Why life is so complex!* So, I would end with something to be occupied with-

*The chances of finding out what really is going on in the universe are so remote, the only thing to do is hang the sense of it and keep yourself occupied.*
